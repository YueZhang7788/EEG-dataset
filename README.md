This SSVEP dataset includes EEG recordings from five participants using electrodes in the following numerical order: PO3 (1), O2 (2), O1 (3), Cz (4), CPz (5), PO8 (6), PO7 (7), Pz (8), FCz (9), Fz (10), FP1 (11), AFz (12), Oz (13), PO4 (14), FP2 (15), POz (16), with FPz as the ground;

There was a 4×3 stimulus matrix on a 23.6-inch LCD monitor with a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. Twelve stimuli were coded using JFPM approach. The frequencies ranged from 9.25 Hz to 14.75 Hz with an interval of 0.5 Hz. The phase differed from 0π to 1.5π , and the interval was 0.5π.
